<p>
  Hey there, fellow meditation enthusiasts and wannabe zen masters! Let me tell
  you a story about my journey from a frustrated meditator to accidental GenAI
  app developer. Or should I say ChatGPT wrapper developer ðŸ¥±.
</p>

<h3>The Pre-recorded Predicament</h3>

<p>
  Like many of you, I'm a regular meditator and faithful user of guided
  meditation apps. You know the drill - soothing voice, gentle instructions,
  occasional gong sounds. It's great... until it isn't.
</p>

<p>
  Here's the thing: I've used these apps so much that I've got them timed down
  to the second. "Breathe in deeply," comes right after my left foot falls
  asleep. "Let go of your thoughts," chimes in just as I remember I forgot to
  buy milk.
</p>

<h3>The Interruption Irritation</h3>

<p>
  The real kicker? Sometimes I'm actually in the zone, floating in a blissful
  meditative state, when BAM! "Now, focus on your breath." Thanks, app. I was
  focusing on enlightenment, but sure, let's go back to breathing.
</p>

<h3>The Lightbulb Moment</h3>

<p>
  That's when it hit me: Why can't my meditation app read the room (or in this
  case, read my mind)? If it could tell when I'm deep in meditation, it could
  hold off on the instructions until I actually need them.
</p>

<h3>Enter Ananda: Your AI Meditation Buddy</h3>

<p>
  So, I put on my developer hat and created Ananda (shoutout to Claude!). Here's
  the cool part:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    It uses your camera to estimate your heart rate, breathing rate, and how
    fidgety you are (technical term: stillness) using some fancy rPPG algorithm
    magic.
  </li>
  <li>
    This data (only text part) gets fed to GPT-4, which is like giving a
    meditation guru a supercomputer.
  </li>
  <li>
    Based on your current state, it decides when to give you the next
    instruction. Deep in meditation? It'll let you be. Starting to drift? It'll
    gently guide you back.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Be a Meditation Pioneer!</h3>

<p>
  Now, here's where you come in. This is a whole new approach to guided
  meditation, and I need your help to see if it actually works. Does AI-guided
  meditation take you to new levels of zen? Or does it just make for a good tech
  conversation starter?
